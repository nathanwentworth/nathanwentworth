# Hardware

## Desktop

I initially built this desktop as a replacement for my laptop, but I quickly realized that macOS is pretty essential for many of my workflows (WSL is nice, but I prefer a deeper integration with the OS). After a few months as a hackintosh, [I installed Ubuntu, which now acts as its primary OS](/posts/from-mac-to-linux). This computer is quickly becoming my daily driver for development work and occasionally playing games.

## Laptop

This laptop has been my main everything-machine since I bought it. It's powerful enough to handle most tasks with ease (except for a Unity lighting build) but light enough to carry with me where ever I need to go. It's the perfect laptop for me â€” apart from the occasional GPU failures and battery issues.
