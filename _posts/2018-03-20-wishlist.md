A consistently-updated list of things that I want to buy, gift ideas, etc! Bold things are higher priority/desire.

- **[Playstation](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/playstationnetwork/psn-cards/)**
  - I buy most of my games digitally (a lot of games I like are digital-only), and I play most of my games on my PS4
- **[Nintendo eShop](https://www.nintendo.com/giftcards)**
  - I bought a Switch a few months ago and don't have a lot of games for it, mainly because Nintendo games never go on sale and stay full-price forever
