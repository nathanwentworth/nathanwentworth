First-person cooking game, where you make cat food for cats. Made in a week for the [Games Made Quick 1Â½](https://itch.io/jam/games-made-quick-one-and-a-half) jam. [Download](https://wickedly.itch.io/sukis-soul-food) [Source](https://github.com/theconbot/Cat-In-a-Truck)

I did about 50% of the programming and all of the UI design/implementation. While [Connor](https://connor.games) made the base ingredient/recipe data structures, I made code to generate [recipes](https://github.com/TheConBot/Cat-In-a-Truck/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/RecipeGenerator.cs) and the [visuals](https://github.com/TheConBot/Cat-In-a-Truck/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/RecipeVisualGenerator.cs) for them. I also made the code for the [paw movement](https://github.com/TheConBot/Cat-In-a-Truck/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/PawMovement.cs) and interactions. Lastly, I wrote the [highscore network code](https://github.com/TheConBot/Cat-In-a-Truck/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/StoreHighScores.cs).
