Moodboard/inspiration collection app made in electron, pulls from a local folder and shows you a grid of images with subdirectory navigator. Tons of customizable options. [Download](https://github.com/nathanwentworth/moodbored/releases/latest) [Source](https://github.com/nathanwentworth/moodbored)

# Features

- View folders of images on your computer
- Change css to suit your style (dark background? rounded corners? etc)
- Drag images from your computer or web browser directly into the gallery to add to the current folder, or onto a folder name to add to that folder instead
- Drag a folder into the view to open a new directory
- Protip: have the directory be a cloud-synced folder (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc) and have it update across computers
  - OR, have it be a shared cloud-synced folder to have a collaborative moodbored/inspiration folder
