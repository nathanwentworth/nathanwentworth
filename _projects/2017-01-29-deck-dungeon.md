Card-based dungeon-crawling game made for the Games Made Quick jam. Featured on [Warp Door](http://warpdoor.com/2017/01/23/deck-dungeon-nathan-wentworth/), [Jupiter Hadley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11tkXjJGpCQ), [Team Know How](https://www.teamknowhow.com/discover/discover/top-free-mac-games#Deck%20Dungeon), and others.

One of the suggestions of the game jam was to use something you haven't used before, so I decided to make a framework-less, canvas-less, javascript game that only uses normal html elements. While the "game" aspect of the game is pretty broken — someone even wrote a script to win the game without playing — I'm pretty satisfied with it as a project and I'd love to revisit it at some point to rework the mechanics.

Heavily inspired by [Donsol](https://hundredrabbits.itch.io/donsol) by [Hundred Rabbits](http://100r.co/)
