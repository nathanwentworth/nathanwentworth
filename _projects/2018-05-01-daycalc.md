This script calculates the number of days between two dates, or the date a certain number of days before/after another date.

Output is as minimal as possible, either an ISO8601 formatted date or a number.

I often need this information because of net30 invoices (figuring out when to set the due date, how long it's been since I sent an invoice, etc) and every web site I found to do this was clunky or too much work.

    import datetime, sys

    def main(argv):
      start = None
      end = None
      diff = 0
      for index, arg in enumerate(argv):
        if (arg == "-s" or arg == "--start"):
          start = datetime.datetime.strptime(argv[index + 1], "%Y-%m-%d")
        elif (arg == "-e" or arg == "--end"):
          end = datetime.datetime.strptime(argv[index + 1], "%Y-%m-%d")
        elif (arg == "-d" or arg == "--diff"):
          diff = int(argv[index + 1])

      if (start != None and end != None):
        print((end - start).days)
      elif (start != None and diff != 0):
        print(start + datetime.timedelta(diff))
      elif (end != None and diff != 0):
        print(end - datetime.timedelta(diff))
      else:
        print('''
      Welcome to daycalc
      All date formats must be ISO8601, YYYY-MM-DD

      -s, --start     set start date
      -e, --end       set end date
      -d, --diff      set difference

      Setting a start and end will return the number of days between the two (exclusive)
      Setting a start and a diff will give you the date [d] days after the start date
      Setting an end and a diff will give you the date [d] days before the end date
    ''')

      pass
