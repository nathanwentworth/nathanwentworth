Browser extension that replaces the default new tab page with a customizable clock. Download for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/time-tab/fdjemjfcplhejdekgjbdjjobbkipoddd) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/time-tab/). [Source](https://github.com/nathanwentworth/time-tab)

Not my first new tab Chrome extension, but the first one uploaded to the Chrome webstore. Made in the course of a couple of weeks during other projects.
