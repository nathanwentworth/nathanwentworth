A web scraper set up to pull posts from [brutalist websites](http://brutalistwebsites.com) and generate a paginated version of the site with ten posts per page.

The original site — while a great collection of interesting web design (I have separate issues with using the term brutalism here) — is over 200mb when fully loaded. I built this scraper to make this site a bit more friendly to people on capped data connections, slow connections, or slow computers.
