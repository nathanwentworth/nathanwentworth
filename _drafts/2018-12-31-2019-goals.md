title: "2019 Goals"
---

Inspired by John and Will Wiesenfeld and their [episode of 2.0 on New Year's](http://2pointohpodcast.libsyn.com/new-years-20), I'm viewing these largely as "focus points". Rather than setting huge goals that just set me up for disappointment, these are just things I want to focus on as areas I want to improve. The only hard goals I'm setting are books and movies, since I feel both are doable.
