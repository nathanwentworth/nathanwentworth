I am horribly conflicted the whole time playing this game. On one hand, the level design is incredible, movement fluid and fun, dialogue just punchy enough to be interesting (I love the dialogue choices in the middle of running around doing things). Yet, it's a first-person shooter. I so rarely play shooters at all that it feels truly bizarre playing this one, and enjoying it as much as I am. 

In my high school years I would play Call of Duty and Halo for hours on end every day — my total time playing Call of Duty 4 alone is over two weeks — starting in college I lost almost all interest in the genre, and my growing political leanings have made the strong presence of guns feel even more distasteful. Parts of this game even feel like they would have been better without guns: a *Mirror's Edge*-like platformer where you're outnumbered and out-gunned by forces in an unfamiliar terrority would suit this game perfectly. The first main area of the game largely is this, traversing environments to collect batteries for your new Titan. This area, and many others, use sense of scale to make you feel small. You are tiny in this world and the verticality sells that.





Despite all of this: I hope this game is an influence on other AA/AAA games in the future. Video games need more tight, focused campaigns that don't have an abundance of tacked-on mechanics or story padding to hit that 60-hour mark.
