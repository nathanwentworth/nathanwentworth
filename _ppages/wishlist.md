A consistently-updated list of things that I want to buy, gift ideas, etc! Bold things are higher priority/desire.

## Gift Cards
- **[Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/gift_cards)**
  - This is 100% my favorite place to get music these days, DRM-free downloads and streams, merch, supports artists, etc! Here's some specific albums I want: [Bandcamp wishlist](https://bandcamp.com/nathanwentworth/wishlist)
- **[Playstation](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/playstationnetwork/psn-cards/)**
  - I buy most of my games digitally (a lot of games I like are digital-only), and I play most of my games on my PS4
- **[Nintendo eShop](https://www.nintendo.com/giftcards)**
  - I bought a Switch last year and don't have a lot of games for it, mainly because Nintendo games never go on sale and stay full-price forever
