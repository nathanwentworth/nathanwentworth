title: "Websites I Like"
---

Inspired by the [XXIIVV webring](https://webring.xxiivv.com/) (which I'm part of), this is a list of websites that I like, either people that I think are interesting, or services that have a philosophy that I enjoy.

> This webring is an attempt to inspire artists & developers to build their own website and share traffic among each other. The ring welcomes personalized websites such as diaries, wikis & portfolios.
