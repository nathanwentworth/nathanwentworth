## Desktop

### Hardware

I initially built this desktop as a replacement for my laptop, but I quickly realized that macOS is pretty essential for many of my workflows (WSL is nice, but I prefer a deeper integration with the OS). After a few months as a hackintosh, [I installed Ubuntu, which now acts as its primary OS](/posts/from-mac-to-linux). This computer has become my daily driver for development work and playing games.

### Software

#### Code/Work

I use [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) for pretty much everything writing related. I occasionally use vim when sshing into a server, but I still prefer a GUI-based text editor for daily usage. I use the following extensions with it: 

- Theme: Spacegray
- Color Scheme: Mariana
- Extensions:
  - MarkdownEditing
  - JavaScript Completions
  - SideBarEnhancements
  - ColorPicker
  - Autoprefixer

I use Firefox as my primary browser, with Chromium as my secondary/work browser. I like keeping my personal life on one with work on the other, since that allows me to mentally switch modes easier than if everything was in one profile.

#### Media

- mpv
- Spotify (reluctantly)
- RhythmBox

## Laptop

I use this laptop much less than I used to, mostly due to performance and battery life issues. While I love macOS, this computer is definitely near the end of its life.

I have an iPhone 6S (white, 128gb) that I bought at launch and don't see myself getting rid of any time soon. The battery life isn't amazing, but it gets the job done (and still has a headphone jack!).
