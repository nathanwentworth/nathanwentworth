## Hardware

### Desktop

I initially built this desktop as a replacement for my laptop, but I quickly realized that macOS is pretty essential for many of my workflows (WSL is nice, but I prefer a deeper integration with the OS). After a few months as a hackintosh, [I installed Ubuntu, which now acts as its primary OS](/posts/from-mac-to-linux). This computer has become my daily driver for development work and playing games.

### Laptop

I use this laptop much less than I used to, mostly due to performance and battery life issues. While I love macOS, this computer is definitely near the end of its life.

- 16GB RAM
- 250Gb SSD
- NVidia 650M
