Hi! I'm nathan wentworth, I make [video games](/game) and [websites](/web). I used to [take photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/nathanwentworth). I like using vanilla/ES6 JavaScript, Unity C#, and Python. Recently I've been into making CLI tools and server-side web apps.

I'm interested in design, open source software, minimalism, fashion, and the intersection of technology and humanity.

Currently working freelance for [FableVision Studios](http://www.fablevisionstudios.com/).

Feel free to talk to me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/nathanwentworth)!
