I went to go see the [Chainsaw Man movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWacdcatC9o) in theaters on monday, suuuuuuper good, I never watched the tv anime but I read the manga, and this movie changed everything I wasn't into about the anime aesthetically. Tatsuki Fujimoto said he was inspired by the [Before trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_trilogy) of films for this arc so I guess I should finally get around to watching those! I watched the third one in theaters when it came out knowing literally nothing about any of them, which is funny to me, kinda defeats some of the purpose of the structure lol!! 

Conversely, saw [Bugonia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p4BCpJ44Qg), didn't like it as much as I expected, the whole thing just felt deeply cynical and nowhere near as weird as I was lead to believe based on trailers/pre-release discussion

Not a huge star wars fan but their Visions series has been consistently great, and this newest season has a short directed by Shinya Ohira, unbelievably gorgeous, can't get over it.

I went to Olivia's Halloween party on Saturday, which was less party and more interactive theater/puzzle game. I've been hearing about the concept for a few months now, but I went in knowing very little other than it being a mixture of social deduction, character roleplay, and puzzle solving. The whole thing was SO impressive, so well written and the puzzles were well-designed, such a clever design trick to preface the whole thing with "you're competing with the other groups to be elected as the next leader, and you all distrust each other at least a little bit" to then immediately force every group to communicate and work together by giving everyone incomplete pieces of puzzles without telling anyone that they're incomplete.

It's always interesting in these things how groups naturally break into two types, the social deduction, getting information for other people, leaning into their role type, and the people that are just there to solve the puzzles. Unsurprisingly I'm 100% the puzzle type, and these were really fun, I think my favorite was near the end where you needed to descipher a paragraph of text (alphabet substitution) with no key, but a few context clues to help you along, and then from there it was just inferring the letters based on what you assume they were. So fun!!!!

Next week I'm doing a charity event at my work which I'm super excited for, I've had a much bigger hand in organizing it this year, and I'm bringing in my DDR setup again. I have to assume that'll be the bulk of my post for next week lol. If anyone [wants to donate](https://www.extra-life.org/participants/558610) I'd be very appreciative n_n

Things I've been into this week!!!

- [G Jones B2B Eprom - Live @ Oslo Hackney London](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Dxc8_Izao8) - really good set, haven't heard Can't Wait To in so long. I neeeeed that wavedash/porter robinson track to come out already
- [choke enough (expansion pack) by Oklou](https://oklou.bandcamp.com/album/choke-enough-expansion-pack) - four more great tracks from Oklou, love the fish song cover. did you know her name is pronounced "o-k-lou"??? i sure didn't
- halfway through The Anthropologists by Ayşegül Savaş, from Mariah's recommendation. really really good so far
- thinking a lot about [this jacket](https://en.frizm.co.kr/product/karakoram-down-parka-005-orange/3768/category/24/display/1/), a recreation of the Eddie Bauer Kara Koram parka from the 1950s. such a [nice color](https://thesecondbutton.com/the-orange-kara-koram/), i'm wondering if the iPhone 17 pro orange was inspired by this? Especially since a lot of their advertising around it was how durable it is (and the apple watch ultra and all that)
