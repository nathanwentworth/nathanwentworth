Last week before The Holidays start, though they kinda already did since I had my work holiday party on thursday and my friend party on saturday~!

But first, on tuesday, we had the manga club meeting and read a not-manga, [For Your Murder](https://www.webtoons.com/en/drama/for-your-murder/list?title_no=8163). Pretty compelling plot, got me thinking about what I like in this type of story, and I think I mostly just enjoy a good detective procedural more than anything, it had me thinking of [Manhunter](https://letterboxd.com/film/manhunter/) a lot and how much I love that tension of like, "will they figure it out in time????"

I'm going to a wedding in february and so I've finally had to buy a suit, I've been researching and looking at options, and me being me I reallllllyyy didn't want to buy something bad or of cheap quality (and I'm such a hater of modern suit tailoring), and since they're an expensive piece of clothing regardless that means I went to ebay. I bought three that are all pretty similar in sizing, but all different enough where hopefully at least ONE fits really well, or at least close enough where alterations can do the rest. Three ebay suits was only 150 dollars which is like 1/4 less than I was ready to pay so even after alterations that'll be a great deal lmao (especially for something I'll wear at most once per year).

Now that it's winter I'm back to engaging with my hobbies, and with the encouragement of one of my coworkers I'm back into learning guitar!!!!!!! She recommended Marin Music Center on youtube and his style rules, super entertaining but I feel like I'm still really learning stuff. I previously used Rocksmith which, while cool, felt a bit too much like I was learning how to play rocksmith rather than actually learning how to play guitar. Like I wasn't focusing on how I sounded, just on if I was getting a good score. So now I'm doing my IIDX method of not sticking with any one song to learn and instead hopping around to a bunch that sound interesting, returning to earlier ones when I feel like it, and ideally I'll be better at it by practicing a lot in general and gaining that breadth of skill. Some I'm learning!!!! [Covet by Basement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97iDQ8SRqxQ), [In The Aeroplane Over the Sea by Neutral Milk Hotel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0udOJYew2A), [When The Sun Hits by Slowdive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6UiPw6g82w)

Thursday I had my work party!!!!! It's kinda far from the office, so some of us took the commuter rail in which was kind of a Vibe, I love hanging out with my coworkers so it was very fun :')))) I baked the NYT eggnog snickerdoodle cookies (thank you mariah!!!!!!) and I was soooooo stressed about them but I had four people compliment them so I'm pleased with the results. I'll make them again because what else am I going to use rum extract in .........

Friday after work some coworkers and I played ping pong for 2 hours... crazy. Then we got dinner at a new-to-us place near our work that was sooooo yommy. Got indian butter chicken, I need to go again tbh

Then saturday was the annual friend christmas party!!!!!! Connor and I started it many years ago and it's just kept going, with last year's being the most people that came, and thankfully this year's was slightly smaller, but it's so hard narrowing down who to invite with how many friends we want to invite u_u a terrible problem to have lmao. But it was really fun and great to see so many people, including some that I don't get to see too often. yayyyyyyy
