omg how embarassing I totally forgot to write this until today LOL well whatever it's not that interesting anyway. Work has been pretty slow this past week, as to be expected with everyone on vacation still, but also because both of my projects are in a bit of a client feedback/wrapping up phase.

I went to Porter Robinson's new years eve eve DJ set which is the 10th time I've seen him live!!!! Soooooo fun, really great track selection, including one of my favorite songs of the year :3c By the end of the night I was really close to [this guy recording the entire thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_5lLW6o6r8) so you can watch all of it if you want!!! It got out at 2am which is so late for me and I was sooooo sleepy yet of course could not fall asleep until like after 3. Ran into a friend from college there which was super cool and unexpected, the last time I saw him was when I saw Porter in brooklyn many years ago haha

For actual New Year's Eve I went to the local pinball place for a little bit, and then some other friends wanted me to go to a bar so I went since it was only like a 15 minute walk away, but when I got there they were at capacity and not letting more people in so I just went home lmao yayy. On the way there I stopped into my apartment to grab earplugs because I went to the same place last year and it was unbelievably loud. I think I preferred the vibes at the pinball place tbh.........

I didn't do much the rest of the week, my copy of Stop!! Hibari-kun! finally arrived so I read all of that. Both pretty funny and charming and also has aged kinda horribly, as to be expected of a manga from the 80s about a trans woman. But Hisashi Eguchi is one of the best ever so at least it has some really nice art!!!

Saturday I went to Ikea with Sean and we got some new rugs and lamps, both of which the apartment has really needed. Every year I get a bonus at work and I stress out about what to spend it on so it's nice to force myself to actually buy something instead of just forgetting about it in my bank account!

After Ikea we watched Uncut Gems since Sean had never seen it. It's funny rewatching that after seeing Marty Supreme and realizing just how small it feels in comparison, and nowhere near as stressful as I remembered!!!! Sunday we went to go see Marty Supreme, my second time. Banger movie honestly
