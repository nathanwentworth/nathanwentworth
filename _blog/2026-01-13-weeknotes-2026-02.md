omg how embarassing it's the second week in a row where I forgot to write this by monday, I only remembered when mariah messaged me at like 10:30 last night and I was too sleepy to put any effort into it. Did I do anything particularly interesting? Who's to say!

While I haven't been reading a ton recently, I did have a wild parasocial relationship moment with one of my favorite musicians, since for the last year+ most of his online presence is just posting book covers on instagram of whatever he's reading, and when he posted about Notes of a Crocodile I was like "whatever i'm just gonna message him to say that I appreciate his taste in books" and he responded and we had a brief conversation about it!! Kinda cool to me!!! It's funny how back in high school I would have zero issue with messaging people on the internet that I thought were cool and now I would pretty much never do that. I know the online landscape has changed considerably in the last decade but mannnnn sometimes it still does good things!

I finally bought my new ping pong paddles and I've been playing a LOT at work. Like two days last week I played for an hour and a half after 5pm. It's taken a minute to really get used to the new style (before we only had hardbat and then really old modern style ones that had zero grip or sponge left), but I've gradually been really getting it. It's great having a fun activity that is a) not computer-based, b) a good opportunity for conversation, and c) a good source of exercise (my favorite kind, cardio). While I love biking, it requires that everyone involved has a bike, AND unless you're on a trail it kinda sucks to talk while biking. And best of all it's completely free for me to play :3c

On monday I went to go see [Resurrection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIJezWgFUEY), absolute banger film, highly recommend. Incredibly gorgeous, great music, and a really great performance from Jackson Yee. The 30 minute one-take final section is worth seeing it alone imo, not only a cool segment on its own, but once you realize it's in one-take seeing all of the coreography gets even more impressive

Went on a date on saturday at my favorite coffee/tea place and it was Okay but I already know I will not be hearing from her again lmao! Oh well! Dating consistently feels very bleak but I at least feel like I'm finally getting better at it at least ?? hopefully (after re-reading this sentence, the idea of "getting better at dating" feels sooooooo insane to me, as someone who has only ever had relationships that developed out of pre-existing friendships. probably why the whole thing feels so bizarre to me)

I also picked up Death Stranding 2 from the library after I've been on hold for a couple months, but I only have two weeks to play the entire game which will notttt happen, so I'll just have to put myself back on the waitlist when it runs out to be able to finish it in another couple of months lol

Over the weekend I got to hang out with Sean's friends twice, once for a post-holiday party where we discussed 2026 goals (of which I have very few!) and had everyone listen to our favorite songs of the year. My picks were [hey phone by peterparker69](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjiWuJDIJzE), [ack! by lanpage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYI11Lg415U), and [what is forever for by frost children](https://frostchildren.bandcamp.com/track/what-is-forever-for), all great songs imo!!!!!!!! They're big Social Event hosters which rules, I love it, my schedule is full and I am thriving

Crazy coincidence that happened there, I was talking to one of their friends that I hadn't met before and I mention where I work, and she is immediately like "oh do you know \[coworker's name]?" and she went on to say that she was her classmate in college. Which makes sense, we've had lots of interns and freelancers from their school. BUT!!!!! When I talked to that coworker after, she brought up her instagram and I realized that I had bought art from her at an art show last year LOL. Crazy!!!!!!!!!! 

I've been slacking on playing guitar recently which I'll blame on having too much fun with friends but I know it's also partially because of too much social media time as always. Saying this here just to hold myself accountable i guess~

Things I've been into this week!!!

- [Ryan Hemsworth -  Body Pillow (feat. Ricky Eat Acid) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyD6aAps928)
- [fun conversation with josh safdie and chloé zhao](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn1o29uZFC4), their energies (both in this interview and in their movies) could not be more different, yet they vibe and bounce off each other really well anyway. had no idea josh safdie was so into new age stuff
- love everything becca farsace does, but i really appreciate her consistently talking about how you [shouldn't buy new tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyROrlgXuxM), and something a few years old will be just as good and much cheaper, not to mention preventing more e-waste. always great to see from a tech youtuber
- art i liked!!!
