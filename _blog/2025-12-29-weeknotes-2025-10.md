Whoaaaaa it's christmas time! I had two pretty leisurely days at work this week before having two days off to see the family. Tuesday I baked two batches of cookies for my dad's gift, the eggnog snickerdoodles I made last week and the [broma baking chocolate chip cookies](https://bromabakery.com/best-chocolate-chip-cookies/) using tcho chocolate. Soooooo good, super rich, highly recommend. I gotta bake with browned butter more often since I don't have a mixer lol.

Suit update!!!!! The first one that arrived (and the smallest) seems to fit the best! The other two, which are both 42Ls are wayyyyy too long, but the 40R fits perfectly. I guess I have a short torso? I'll probably sell the other two! Not a bad deal really, here I was prepared to spend like 600 dollars and I got away with effectively only spend like 150 (and probably closer to 75 after I re-sell the other two)

I'm almost done with [The Summer Book](https://www.nyrb.com/products/the-summer-book), I read more of it on the train and I only have a couple chapters left!! Really nice, though I kinda wish I had read something else first only because I've been reading a lot of "short vignettes" type books recently, with The Anthropologists and Burning Chrome. Maybe I'll finally read one of the books I bought in california/oregon next!!!! I was going to read more of it at my parent's house but my brother and I started watching A Better Tomorrow (and did not finish it, i finished it the next day when i got home) and that movie rules!!!!! Real Dudes Rock cinema. 

Speaking of Dudes Rock cinema, Jonah and I went to see Marty Supreme which owned. Already have plans to see it again next week lmao. Okay I mean it's not really "Dudes Rock" in that Marty kinda sucks but it has that energy, you know. makes me want to get into ping pong even more even though that is not at all what the movie is _really_ about

The weekend was pretty leisurely, I was doing Adult Things like setting up a roth IRA which I guess I should have set up years ago????? Since there's a maximum annual contribution limit???? Oh well whatever I have enough in savings where I can fully fund it for a few years. So uh thanks to my brother for judging me for having too much money in a savings account lol. I found these videos ([1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcJ1snkCPwA), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKH62jZl0Q), [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Aiu7THlLUI)) from The Money Guy to be pretty helpful in explaining their whole deal, and they do a nice job of like, reassuring you that it's never too late to think about it and all that. yay

I went on a Date on sunday which was nice!!!! She lived in Taiwan for a while which is yet another sign that I should go there on vacation....... Afterwards I re-watched Baby Driver with michael, which I enjoyed more this time I think. The first like, 25 minutes alone are pretty flawless. Also been playing more Death Stranding and I think I'm back to where I was the first time I tried playing it, this time in significantly less time (I'm not really bothering building out the roads, before I was like "well I need to complete the road before I get to the next area" which takes forever). I'm only 4 spots away for my DS2 library hold so I gotta speed it up I think
