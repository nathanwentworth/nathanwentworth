Okay so this past week was pretty uneventful, which is fine!!!!! We had manga club on tuesday, talked about Tokyo These Days by Taiyo Matsumoto (the goat) which I really enjoyed. I need to read more of his stuff I think, I've had the first two volumes of Sunny for years and just never read it for some reason. It's so funny to me how I can kinda blast through a volume of a comic/manga in like two hours and getting myself to start is the hardest part!!!

I played a bunch more Death Stranding 2, got about 1/3 of the way through but then I had to return it to the library (re-applied for a hold and I'm 5th so I'll have it back soon). It's kinda crazy how different the vibe in DS2 is compared to 1. Like it feels SO much like MGSV. I don't have a ton to say that I didn't say in my post last week, but I am curious to see how the plot works out. Like I think so much of what made DS1 work so well was the very dreary, melancholic tone combined with the story of bringing people out of isolation via the internet. DS2 has a way less melancholic tone and it _seems_ like it's more about bringing people out of isolation by being around other people, reconnecting IRL. Which would make sense based on the tagline "Should we have connected?", at first I assumed that was like "maybe we shouldn't have connected the chiral network (internet)" in the first one, but maybe it's about the _way_ we connected, virtually via the internet instead of in person???? We shall see...........

Was supposed to go on a date this week and she canceled the day of and then unmatched from me like 3 hours later, lol, lmao. Dating continues to be terrible but hey what else is new!!!

On a POSTIVE note, I've been playing a ton of ping pong in the office still :3c On friday Maham and Snow and I were doing rotating 1v1 games and it was probably the most fun I've had with it so far. I really feel like I'm getting the hang of my forehand and hitting fast, powerful shots. I ended up winning against Maham which was crazy!! When we were playing by ourselves earlier in the week she was like "I hope we don't get bored of this" and I feel like one of the biggest things that has me enjoying it is that it's an inherently social experience. Like you can't play solo at all (unless you have one of those robot servers) so getting to hang out with someone while playing is basically all the motivator I need to keep going. AND it helps that she's better than me so I have a target to work towards lol. Speaking of ping pong, A24 is selling the [Marty Supreme table tennis balls](https://shop.a24films.com/products/marty-supreme-championship-table-tennis-balls) so I think I have to buy some......
