Actually writing this on a Sunday for once wowowowww, it's soooo cold today and it snowed even more yesterday, but it's supposed to finally go above freezing next week and i'm soooo excited. I watched more Buffy with Olivia today for the first time since november!! We're a third of the way through the final season.... so close..... After we finish I'm going to make her watch The Tatami Galaxy i think, essential nathan and mariah media. Played more Death Stranding 2 afterwards, also a bit more of a third of the way though that, no way I'm going to finish it by the next library return date but as of right now there's no one on the waitlist so maybe I can just auto-renew it??? hopefully!! On friday a chunk of ice fell through the skylight in the office so I guess tomorrow we have to wfh... tragic

On monday I went to go see Marty Supreme AGAIN (my third time) with some coworkers, this time in IMAX. Still really good on a third watch, I think this was the first time I've seen a movie in imax??? At least in my adult life, for sure. Do I think the imax really added anything to the experience? not really!! but whatever it was fun, and fun to discuss with people who hadn't seen it yet (half really loved it, half hated it lmao)

On wednesday it was my birthday and I did nothing for it lmao. BUT!!!!!! coworker gabby drew me this wonderful illustration of me with hachiware :')))))) I love it sooooo much :')))))

Normally when I bike into work I don't listen to music or anything since I want to be fully aware of the road around me. I probably _could_, it's not like any of my earbuds block a lot of outside noise and I'm pretty much never using sound cues to navigate cars, really just listening for other bikers announcing passes, but since I've been taking the bus the last two weeks I've been listening to music on the commute in, and when getting off the bus I dropped my earbuds and stepped on them and they shattered u_u So I did some research into what to replace them with, since they're good but there's soooo many options out there, why not try something new? I went with the [Nicehck EB2S](https://www.nicehck.com/products/nicehck-eb2s-15-4mm-dynamic-driver-in-ear-earphones-japanese-lpc-diaphragm-1dd-simple-and-classic-design-aluminum-alloy-housing-0-1-inch-3-5-mm-balance-plug-high-purity-copper-cable-included) which seem pretty nice, they review well and I love an aluminum shell vs the plastic MX500 style you usually see with flathead earbuds. Will post my review here whenever they arrive 🫡

Suit update, Saturday was my coworker Esther's wedding!!!! It was soooo wonderful :')))) I've never been to such a christian wedding before and I'm pretty sure her entire church community was in attendance, since whenever there was singing or praying involved I would glance around and my coworkers and I were the only ones not doing anything lmao. but it was so fun and a really great time and i always love hanging out with my coworkers 🙂‍↕️
