Okay I was out Having Fun monday night, unexpectedly, so I'm writing this tuesday morning in bed before work yay

Saw [Frost Children](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wqMvh02okE) and [peterparker69](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjiWuJDIJzE) this week!!!! Both so good live, honestly so impressed that Frost Children played for a full 90 minutes with how high energy they were the entire time. Peterparker69 (only Jeter was there) was great, really fun hearing their tracks adapted to a live show setting (blending the original of loloi into the aamourocean remix for example), though sad that they didn't have any merch! Danny Brown came out to perform his verse on Shake It Like A which was sooooooo cool, I don't think I've ever been to a show with a surprise guest like that??? (wait that's not true, when I saw Wavedash in Tokyo and Porter Robinson came out for the last 30 minutes)

I started (re-)playing Death Stranding, I played about 20 hours of it a while ago on Game Pass but since I don't have that anymore I had to restart on my PS4. While I wasn't huge into it when I played the first time, I realllllly want to play DS2 so, maybe I'll like it more this time????? I feel like I've been really aware of just how much live-service games I've been playing (Fortnite, Skate, Halo Infinite (though rip lol)) which is great as a vehicle for socializing, but I've been craving a more singular experience in games. Like I've been playing Fortnite on and off for over three years, I just need something new!!!

Finally did a handlebar swap on my orange bike! I did most of it myself, but when I got to the point where I needed to thread the brake cables, I realized that the brakes I bought needed the brake cables to be installed new, brake levers first and then through the rest of the housing, which I didn't have the tools for myself, so I brought it to a shop where they charged almost the entire cost of the parts I bought to install the brakes 😭 oh well!!!!! So much better now :')

Went to my second Pops Pinball tournament this week, it was split flipper where you pair up with someone and one of you uses the left flipper, and the other person uses the right, which is fun~ I got out in two rounds, which is as fastest you could get out lmao. But it was fun! As sean always says, it's just as much about the socializing and a good excuse to hang out with people and get out of the house! I went out for dinner with sean's pinball friends twice this weekend and while I can't see myself ever caring about tournament results or joining league, the casual tournaments are a fun excuse to hang out with them!
