Inspired by [mariah](https://mariah.bearblog.dev/blog/) and many others and also my desire to actually Post (i take a lot of photos that i just don't do anything with because i find posting on bluesky/mastodon/etc annoying for some reason??? maybe it's adding the alt-text that no one i know will ever use but i feel obligated to write lol) i'm gonna start Posting!!!! we'll see how weekly i can make this, maybe it'll motivate me to actually do things during the week if i have the pressure of posting about it. or i'll just skip a week if there's nothing interesting to say!!! who knows!

Last week I went to [ethan's](https://wickedlyethan.com/) halloween party and he gave me an ipod classic that wasn't being used, I went through the process of setting it up only to realize that ipods (on stock firmware) don't support the album artist tag, which would mean i would have to go through all of my albums and mark them as compilations if there's some other artist on there, which would also mess up my entire way of thinking about albums!! Sooooooo I'm thinking I just should switch to rockbox, which is a whole other process, and if I'm doing that, I might as well just open it up and do a flash mod on it. There's lots of good guides out there about how to go about this, with the caveat that the one I have is the most annoying to open up due to the metal front plate, but there's replacement ones out there if I break anything, thankfully!!!

I went to go see [Lamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELSAPf-z9VI) on sunday for the second time after they toured last year, such a good show!!!!! It's always funny going to shows with younger crowds, I never really Got the whole "phones at concerts" thing until seeing Lamp the first time
