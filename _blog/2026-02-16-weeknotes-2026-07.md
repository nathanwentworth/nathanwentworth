Okay I'm late posting this AGAIN because I had to read all of volume 3 of Gundam: The Origin for my manga book club. Really good manga btw!!!!! I got 2 volumes in and I was like "oh okay I get it now". It's been a lot warmer this past week (like actually above freezing) and it's been soooooo nice. Spring will be so soon, I won't have to wear my bomber literally every day! yippee!

Last week was another of fun socializing and ping pong, I played DDR for the first time since november and it's soooo crazy how out of shape I am. Like last year I could play for 30-45 minutes straight without feeling too bad and I could barely make it through three (difficult) songs. I gotta get that pad back into my apartment and start playing again!!!! People love to talk about me biking as though it's some form of strenuous exercise but it's really just like going on a slightly long walk every day, not at all the 160bpm+ heartrate kind of activity that DDR is. Ping pong also, not super strenuous. I definitely work up a sweat (especially playing with Maham) but it's not _that_ bad. This week ramadan starts though which means I won't be able to play ping pong with maham for a month u_u very sad about that

On Sunday it was sean's birthday so we had a big [Halo 3 LAN party which you can read about in way more detail here](https://sean666.bearblog.dev/hosting-a-halo-3-lan-party-in-the-big-26/)!!!! I love hanging out with my friends and playing video games together!! It's crazy how that was so much of my childhood and teen years and even into college, and it only stopped when I graduated and my friends didn't live like, in the same dorm as me lol. But I'm hoping to have a similar thing again soon with a bunch of my work friends, probably not just Halo since I don't think most of them play FPS games and I don't want to subject them to that, but I have sooooo many local multiplayer games that I love that are much more accessible! Towerfall, Videoball, Sportsfriends (if I re-buy a copy), etc. Towerfall specifically was a big hit at our work Extra Life event last november, like a bunch of people got _really_ into it which was great to see.
