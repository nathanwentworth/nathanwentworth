Okay last week's post was sooooooo lazy but I'll just say it's because this week was so busy!! Monday Sean and I got our christmas tree for the year! I'm generally a winter holiday Hater but I do love having a real tree inside, every day I've gotten home and it smells soooooo good inside. 

Some friends and I had a discord manga book club going for most of the year, but we all fell off over the summer for various reasons, but we had our first (mostly unplanned) meeting back finally :'))))))) really glad to be back doing it!!!!! And I'm next pick after this one and I have some Ideas :3c (probably something Taiyo Matsumoto)

Wednesday I went out with some friends to get dinner and play pinball which was nice !! Thursday I had a ticket to see Claire Rousay but it was SO cold that once I got home I really could not be convinced to leave the house. If I was going with someone else or something I'm sure I would have gone, but I could not motivate, so instead I stayed inside and watched Shoplifters finally, which I really loved. It was announced that Hirokazu Kore-eda is directing a [Look Back](https://deadline.com/2025/12/kore-eda-manga-look-back-live-action-tatsuki-fujimoto-1236633546/) adaptation which feels like a perfect fit, really excited to watch that

Saturday was my favorite day of the year, MICE day!!! As I always say, the best thing to do with a paycheck is to immediately give it to artists. Went with some friends (planned) and ran into some coworkers (one kinda planned, one not) which is so fun :')

{% include img.html url='small/IMG_0204.jpeg' lg='large/IMG_0204.jpeg' desc='the haul' %}

- [A Liang Chan](https://www.instagram.com/formyths/)
  - didn't get anything from this artist because they were doing a talk for the hour I was on the show floor which suuuuuucks because I realized later that they aren't selling the prints I wanted online
- [Ash S](https://www.housegoblin.net/): let's get burgers sticker sheet
  - love Let's Get Burgers, which was recommended by my friend Jane
- [Peow2](https://peow.studio/shop/na): yoichi nishikawa art book
  - Jane Mai was there..... she's so cool................
- [Minha Lee](https://www.instagram.com/whatisaminha): b&w zine bottom left
  - gorgeous textures on this zine, also hand numbered/stamped which was fun
- [molar](https://t00thfairies.weebly.com/): sticker sheet in the top left
  - sooo nathan-core
- [endokidd](https://www.instagram.com/endokidd/): zine in the center
  - former intern at my work!!!! i also got a funny sticker not in the photo
- [snailsprite](https://ryleehollis.format.com/): print in the top right
  - love this!!!

I REALLY need to buy some frames for the prints that don't have frames (or frames that are the wrong size) and actually hang them up, I took down the ones on my walls recently and just never replaced them because a couple of the frames I got didn't end up fitting the prints I had super well

Afterwards we went out to get dinner and stopped by a bookstore where I got The Summer Book by Tove Jansson since I just finished my last NYRB book. Mariah was rapid-fire texting me author names to see if the store I was in had any of them and 90% of them was no until she named Tove Jansson and I recognized the cover lol. We went to two japanese grocery stores on that street and the entire time I was like "ohhhhhh why do no stores have a hot drink shelf where they sell warm canned drinks!!!!" crazy living in a city where it's cold for like 5 months of the year and we somehow haven't figured out this technology????

Then Sean and I went to my friend's birthday party which was super fun! I knew some people there but I got to meet her cool grad school friends (bonded with one of them over our love of white monster) and I stayed a lot later than I expected but it was fun so it was worth it

On Sunday I went to a coworker's place for brunch and she made homemade bagels and they were sooooo good and yommy, I took a photo but my camera app didn't save the photo so you'll just have to believe me. After that I went to BFIG which I haven't been to since maybe like 2015?? Which was extra funny seeing a game there that I remember seeing at the last BFIG I went to lmao. BUT I was mostly there to support friend and former coworker Owen and the game he's currently making as a mostly-solo dev!!!!! [Go sign up for his newsletter](https://studiopearl.net/) that exists just to email people when it goes up on steam, it's fun trust me

Oh also on the way to BFIG I got the new winter edition red bull and it's my favorite seasonal flavor of theirs in a verrrry long time, I will definitely be picking some more up soon

When I got home I watched 28 Years Later which was way different than I expected, really good though!! Even if the Call of Duty 360 headshot kill compilation camerawork was hilarious at times lmao
