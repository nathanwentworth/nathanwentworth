## Games

I barely played any video games in 2020, after developing some form of RSI preventing me from using a game controller comfortably. As always, a lot of these games didn't come out in 2020. Beatmania IIDX and Stepmania/DDR have completely dominated my game-playing time, 2020 truly became the year of the rhythm game. I started playing IIDX in November 2019 and by the end of 2020 I was 2-Dan (二段).

## Anime

## Vtuber clips

Much of the second half of 2020 was spent watching vtubers, mainly from hololive. The debut of Hololive EN especially changed my media consumption habits, meaning I was watching a lot more streams than I ever had before.
