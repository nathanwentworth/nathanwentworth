With the import tariffs I've almost completely stopped my art book purchasing, but there was a CD I wanted so I thought I'd make the most of it and import some other art books I'd been looking at!! The fees weren't *that* bad, 19 dollars on a 58 dollar order, which basically cancels out any savings I'd have gotten by the yen being weak. Not happy about it but it could have been worse!!

Things I've been into this week!!!

- Saw Hamnet in theaters, really really beautiful movie!!!!
- Finally got around to watching [Ping Pong (2002)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uG9x5S9T4N8), 13 years after I first learned about it lmao. Why did I wait this long???? This movie rules??? Ping Pong: The Animation is one of my favorite things ever so obviously this was also good
- [goodbye, world! by miffle](https://miffle.bandcamp.com/album/goodbye-world), really nice tape-loop ambient album, reminds me of ricky eat acid
- Finished reading [Stoner by John Williams](https://www.nyrb.com/products/stoner), sooooooo good, glad I finally got around to this one
