Okay not a lot to talk about this week, it's starting to actually get cold which I love for my Fits since I can finally wear all of my fun sweaters (BUT it's so hot in my office that I really can't which is so sad u_u like it should not be 75 indoors in the winter!!! That's too hot!!!) After getting my [3sixteen RS-100xk](https://www.3sixteen.com/collections/denim/products/rs-100xk-relaxed-straight-rinsed-indigo-kibata) they've kinda ruined how all of my other pants fit to me, I think I have to also get them in black because I'm wearing these too much

Another week of going to the casual Pops Pinball tourament, this time I actually did kind of okay! It was "price is right" rules so you had to get as close to the target score on each machine as possible, some of which were comically low (like 250 million on Attack From Mars, which you could easily get without even trying). A few I got really close to getting first place and then I would either just barely go over, or the other people I played with were just That much better and would knock me down a few ranks. It was really fun though!!!!!

I know it's the like, stereotypical startup thing, but my office got a ping pong table a couple weeks ago and some of us have been setting it up and playing on fridays and it's honestly kinda wild how fun it is. Literally feeling like [Smile](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/28498) whenever I get a good point off lmao. My dumb reddit hobby brain is immediately like "I need to get really into this and spend money" but I definitely Do Not need to do that

Made one of my favorite foods, the soda bread my mom often makes, for Sean's friend's friendsgiving on saturday and it turned out shockingly well!!!! It's pretty flat, I think when I make it again I need to use an actual mixer, but it tasted exactly as it should and I'm very pleased with it :')))) So much better than my previous attempts at making any kind of bread LOL (I think the lack of yeast helped)
