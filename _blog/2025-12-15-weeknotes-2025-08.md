I've been playing Halo 3 (MCC) a good amount the last few months, and a couple weeks ago sean and I played Call of Duty Black Ops (2? I forget) and I joked that it would awaken something in me, bringing out my old COD-playing self. So obviously I bought Battlefield 6 which immediately scratches that itch, but thankfully I don't feel as I once did playing COD4 in high school (lmao). It's fun though!!! I haven't played a Battlefield since 3 on the PS3, but this one feels like a middleground between that and later COD games in terms of TTK and speed. The sound design is unreal and combined with the visual effects it really sells the chaos that the larger-scale fights can be. I can't see myself really getting *into it* the way I used to (that would require a constant group of friends to play with I think) but I'm enjoying my time with it!! Also full disclosure, I would not have bought this game at full price, but I have a friend who works at EA so I got it for 11 dollars.

Speaking of video games, my work's game club wrapped up our previous game, Junkbot Undercover, the lego flash game from 2003, and now our next one is What Remains of Edith Finch which I'm excited to play again! I've already played it 3 or 4 times, but it's been a while so it'll be nice revisiting it I think. Kind of a perfect narrative video game to me, honestly. Short and relatively small in scope, but engaging mechanically where each section feels unique. While obviously very different, it feels like it comes from the same design mentality as something like Inside, where each section has a dedicated mechanic that's introduced, and then not repeated later. The fish scene!!!!!! Iconic!!!!!

Speaking of video games again, on thursday I went to the pinball Howdy Partner event (co-op team-based pinball) which was fun! And the best part was that being there forced me to not pay attention to The G\*me Aw\*rds at all, a thing that I think deserves no attention from anyone, though I regrettably end up watching almost every year because I'm on my computer and my friends will want to talk over it while we watch together. I haven't even watched the trailers that came out from it lol

It snowed over the weekend for the first time this winter, so I got dinner with some of sean's friends and we got yummy tofu soup n_n
