Okay so sunday night into monday we had one of the biggest snowstorms we've had in like a decade. We got like 17 inches I think??? Crazy. There's a really wonderful day or two after it happens where there's this great collective energy in the city with everyone shoveling it and clearing roads and everything kinda shuts down a little bit, but sadly it hasn't gotten above freezing in the week since so none of it has melted, so bike lanes aren't clear, tons of sidewalks are mostly cleared but going from the sidewalk to the street is impossible (or the "cleared" is just enough for your feet, not a stroller or wheelchair or anything else) so now it just gets kinda miserable lmaoooooo. I started going into the office via bus which is Fine but takes so long and if you miss the bus there's a solid chance that it'll be another 20 minutes until the next one. I miss biking!!!!!!!! Because of the snow I barely went into the office this week (only twice) which is wild to think that that used to be my normal. I've gotten so used to going in every day that not going in three days in a row makes me feel like I'm going crazy

Suit update!!!!!! On wednesday I biked to the tailors and got it fitted, the whole time the guy was just saying how well it already fit and how they didn't need to do a lot, love to see it honestly!!! Like they didn't even touch the pants or sleeves, just took in a bit in the back. Yay!!!! Only downside is I biked there and back and oh man those roads were NOT bikeable yet. I rode my older bike that has fenders on it and they instantly became packed with slush which was definitely worse than just riding without them, AND I had my suit and shirt and stuff in a tote that got wet from some road splash and I managed to stain my white shirt with dirt despite never even actually wearing it. Tragic.

When I got home I playtested my friend's game again, it's really coming along well! The vibe has changed which I think works for the better, less chaotic and more co-operative. Go sign up for [the newsletter](https://studiopearl.net/)

It's actually wild how much I've gotten into ping pong tbh......... thursday and friday I played for two hours after work, first with Maham and then with Snow. On friday Snow and I were playing a bunch and at one point she changed her grip (since she was trying to return some of the annoying serves I do) and immediately unlocked something within her and she got so good so fast. By the end of the night we were standing far from the table just whipping shots back and forth and it was sooooo fun. It's gonna be so boring when I talk about ping pong every week on here because what even is there to say other than "yay it's fun and i like hanging out with my coworkers" lol

Saturday and Sunday I went to Something in the Way fest 2026! Two day music festival with a ton of great bands. Was talking to my friend that I went with on saturday and honestly there wasn't much of a theme really, like at first I thought it was just bands on Run For Cover Records but a bunch aren't, and there was some genre overlap (lots of emo) but then Explosions in the Sky were the headliners for the first day which felt kinda out of place? But it was sooooo fun, so great to finally see The Hotelier live, and I really loved [First Day Back](https://firstdayback.bandcamp.com/album/forward) on day two. Definitely will be going again next year~
